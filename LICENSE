   2. None of that matters. The terms of use of this work are to be discussed with the Author before use. This is a personal project that I don't want stolen but want public. If you want to base your work off of it, you're welcome to do so after you ask me for it. Depending on the scale of your project and if the project is commercial or personal some payment may be asked, but it's negotiable. I'm not an asshole afterall. Just don't steal my code/idea please.
